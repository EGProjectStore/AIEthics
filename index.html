    <p1 class="textClassHeader">A Website About the Ethical Debate Around AI.</p1>
    <br><br><br>
    <p2 class="textClass" id="TEXT1">Artificial Intelligence and its potential effect on society has been a talking point for years now. Ever since the idea of a man made machine behaving as a human got introduced into society, authors and philosophers have speculated on what digital intelligence on the same level as ours could mean for how we go forward as a species. While we are still a very long way away from being able to say that computers are anywhere near as capable as human intelligence, recent drastic increases in AI capabilities are now forcing us as a society to ask questions about the morals of these programs, and what potential harm they could do to our lives. This website serves as an introductory guide to the common arguments surrounding AI ethics, and how valid I believe them to be.</p2>

    <p1 class="textClassHeader">So What's the Deal With AI "Stealing"?</p1>
    <br><br><br>
    <p2 class="textClass" id="TEXT2">If you’ve spoken to people in artistic communities, read the news, or just generally follow popular conversations, you have probably heard that AI functions by “stealing” from real artists. This comes from the way that modern generative AI’s are created. As finding a “formula” for art manually is likely an impossible task, modern generative AI’s employ a technique called “machine learning”, where they are given a large amount of input and output data, and automatically derive a function that maps between them. This, of course, requires massive quantities of data to work effectively, especially for complicated bots, that say, want to mimic human speech or art. This often necessitates using media scraped from the internet, taken without the consent of the original creators.</p2>

    <p3 class="mediaContent">“The key issue in these cases is that the algorithms have not been specifically programmed to place notes and paint; instead, they ‘learnt’ to do so through processing enormous amounts of data and being given signals on what placements were ‘correct’ or ‘wrong’. On that feedback, they then generated their respective outputs” (Ng 50-51).</p3>

    <p1 class="textClassHeader">Ok, but Are the Robots Coming for My Job?</p1>
    <br><br><br>
    <p2 class="textClass" id="TEXT3">A more mainstream and perhaps older fear regarding AI, is that of job security. The threat is obvious: if a robot can think like a human, it can do human work. And you don't need to pay robots. This has led to a great deal of fear regarding the threat of AI “replacing” humans in the workforce, leading to a dystopian future where humans lose their value and ability to earn. While new technologies have been replacing jobs since humans realized how to grow crops, AI does possess a unique threat in how general it can be, theoretically being capable of any “intellectual” based work, posing a potential risk to an amount of jobs larger than any technology we have seen before.</p2>

    <p3 class="mediaContent">"A recent Pew Research Center survey finds that many U.S. workers in more exposed industries do not feel their jobs are at risk – they are more likely to say AI will help more than hurt them personally. For instance, 32% of workers in information and technology say AI will help more than hurt them personally, compared with 11% who say it will hurt more than it helps" (Kochhar).</p3>

    <br><br><br>
    <p2 class="textClass" id="TEXT4">While you can argue all day about the validity of the previous arguments, some threats are less theoretical than others. AI as a tool for misinformation is already causing problems with falsified information online. While people have been spreading fake stories since the dawn of time, AI automation has made convincing news reports, videos, images, and much more easier than ever, leading to obvious problems. The conversation around AI generated misinformation is less about if it's a problem, and more about how we should address it. Regulation around what commercial AI can generate, with stricter guidelines on content moderation has been floated as a potential fix, while at the same time people have argued that increased regulation would just lead to a neutering of AI capabilities.</p2>

    <p3 class="mediaContent">“The rise of AI fake news is creating a ‘misinformation superspreader’” highlights how AI is used to create propaganda, commenting that “Well-dressed AI-generated news anchors are spewing pro-Chinese propaganda, amplified by bot networks sympathetic to Beijing. In Slovakia, politicians up for election found their voices had been cloned to say controversial things they never uttered” (Verma).</p3>
